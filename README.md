# Physics_Chap1_Cpp
Units, Physical Quantities and Vectors

This is my Chapter 1 physics exercises.
I found old books fascinating because it doesn't have answers  in each exercises.
This kinda means that i might have no frickin idea on how to calculate these.
Its good to make it because you'll never know the value to simulate things in c++ when emergency comes.
It's still a messy one but i'll try to make it more advanced as much as possible.
Its a fun adventure if people would also try coding with C++ and physics.
Besides i would like the fact that this can be more of a homework for me to test my C++ skills.
Golang's type of coding kinda confuses me alot which was more boring to code before.
